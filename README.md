## Put.io magnet: and .torrent Handler for OS X [![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/nicoSWD/put.io-adder/latest/total.svg)](https://github.com/nicoSWD/put.io-adder/releases)

![alt tag](http://f.cl.ly/items/0K420o1W192i0i2u0r31/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-07%20at%2017.51.05.png)

*put.io adder* is a small, open source app for OS X, that registers as new handler for **magnet** URI schemes, so that every
time you click on a manget link, it will automatically add it to your [put.io](http://put.io/) download queue.

Versions 1.4 and above now automatically upload .torrent files you choose to open with the app, and add them to the download
queue as well. There are three ways to do that:

- Drag the .torrent file onto the app icon
- Make *put.io adder* your default handler for .torrent files
- Or right click the torrent and pick "Open with" > put.io adder

Versions 2.0 and above now let you see your current transfers. Double clicking a transfer will open it in the browser,
so you can download it. Support for multiple languages has been added. Feel free to add more!

**NOTES**
- The app requires you to have a [put.io](http://put.io/) account. They're probably not free anymore.
- The app requires KeyChain Access to store put.io's OAuth Token. Denying access might prevent the app from working.
- To disable NotificationCenter, go to System Preferences -> Notifications -> Scroll to Put.IO Adder, and make your changes.

*IMPORTANT:* I added [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking), [PutioKit](https://github.com/PutioKit/PutioKit), and [SSKeyChain](https://github.com/samsoffes/sskeychain) as submodules.
So if you want to clone the entire repo, please use:

**CONTRIBUTE**

All contributions are greatly appreciated. If you want to help, send a pull request, or open a [new issue](https://github.com/nicoSWD/put.io-adder/issues/new) with a feature request.
Some ideas for improvement are:

- Check if *put.io adder* is the default handler for magnet links and torrent files on startup. *~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist* needs to be parsed and/or modified for that. If it's not, an alert asking to change that should be fired.
- A ["Default folder preference"](https://github.com/nicoSWD/put.io-adder/issues/3) option could be added.
- An option to download finished transfers to the computer through the app would be nice.
- A setting to automatically *cancel* finished transfers that are currently seeding, in order to speed up the download process of other transfers.
- Design improvements.
- A way to stream finished files through the app.
- ~~Authentication could be improved by adding a new custom URI scheme. When authenticating, the browser should open and go to *put.io's* authentication page, and a callback to something like *putio://callback* would open the app and pass over the OAuth token. Just like [mikker's Putter app does](https://github.com/mikker/Putter.app/blob/master/Putter/BBAppDelegate.m).~~ (Added in v2.7)
- A way to browse through existing files and folders on *put.io*.
- More languages.
- Settings could be moved to a new preference pane in *System Preferences*.
- Besides Notification Center, a badge could be added to the app icon, indicating the number of finished downloads. Or the download progress could be shown there.
- etc...
